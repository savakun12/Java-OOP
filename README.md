# Java OOP Learning

Welcome to the **Java OOP Learning** repository! This repository is designed to help beginners and experienced programmers alike learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java programs and examples that demonstrate various OOP concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Each topic is accompanied by a detailed explanation and example code to help you understand and implement OOP principles effectively in Java.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine and explore the different folders, each representing a different OOP concept in Java. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and start learning!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 11 or higher)
- [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support)

## Topics Covered

This repository covers the following OOP topics:

1. **Classes and Objects**  
   Learn the basics of defining classes and creating objects in Java.

2. **Inheritance**  
   Understand how inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class.

3. **Polymorphism**  
   Explore how polymorphism enables methods to perform different functions based on the object calling them.

4. **Encapsulation**  
   Learn about encapsulation and how it restricts access to certain components of an object.

5. **Abstraction**  
   Understand abstraction and how it helps in reducing complexity by hiding implementation details.

6. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**  
   Discover how to use interfaces and abstract classes to implement abstraction in Java.

7. **Exception Handling**  
   Learn how to handle exceptions and write robust Java code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-oop-learning.git
   cd java-oop-learning
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Make sure your IDE is set up to use the correct JDK version (Java 11 or higher).

## Usage

Navigate through the different folders to find the examples and exercises related to each OOP concept. Each folder contains:

- **Example Code**: Demonstrative code that shows how the concept works.
- **Exercises**: Hands-on exercises to practice the concept.
- **Readme**: A brief explanation of the concept.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different scenarios, and enhance your understanding of Java OOP.
